# Air-canvas-by-ncm

Air Canvas is a computer vision-based project that allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, the program detects hand landmarks and tracks finger movements, enabling the creation of art in mid-air. This interactive application is built using Python and is a fun way to explore gesture-based interfaces.

FEATURES :
1.Draw in the air using hand gestures.

2.Choose different colors and brush thicknesses.

3.Erase parts of the drawing with a simple gesture.

4.Real-time hand tracking using the MediaPipe library.

5.Easy-to-use interface with minimal setup.

Technologies Used:
1.Python: Core language used to build the project.

2.OpenCV: Used for real-time image processing and hand detection.

3.MediaPipe: Provides the hand-tracking module.

4.NumPy: Used for mathematical operations on arrays.
